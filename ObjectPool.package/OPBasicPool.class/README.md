I add some usable fetures to the general object pool.
- validation
- max and min sizes for idle objects.

Things to do:
- max size for borrowed objects.
- max time to wait for object.
- possibility to set if validation occurs befor borrow, after return or while idle.
- background idle cheking.
- time tracking for idle time.
- time tracking for borrow time. (maybe)
